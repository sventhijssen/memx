# MemX: A Python Package for Digital In-Memory Computing on Nanoscale Memristor Crossbars

## Update October 24, 2022
MemX will be released before 31 October 2023. The MemX package will include source code for flow-based computing and path-based computing.
The package is developed to enhance the research towards these digital in-memory computing paradigms.

It will feature the following frameworks:
- [C<sup>2</sup>S<sup>2</sup>](https://github.com/sventhijssen/c2s2)
- [ISO](https://github.com/sventhijssen/iso)
- [XSAT](https://github.com/sventhijssen/xsat)
- [UpTime](https://github.com/sventhijssen/uptime)
- [FLOW-3D](https://github.com/sventhijssen/flow-3d)
- [CHECK](https://github.com/sventhijssen/check)
- [PATH](https://github.com/sventhijssen/path)
- [COMPACT](https://github.com/sventhijssen/compact)
