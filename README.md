# MemX: A Python Package for Digital In-Memory Computing on Nanoscale Memristor Crossbars

## Update June 6, 2022
MemX will be released soon (some code must be cleaned up and some documentation must be provided). The MemX package will include source code for flow-based computing and path-based computing.
The package is developed to enhance the research towards these digital in-memory computing paradigms. It will feature the frameworks [COMPACT](https://github.com/sventhijssen/compact) and [PATH](https://github.com/sventhijssen/path).
